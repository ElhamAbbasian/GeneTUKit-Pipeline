24842107	Disialoganglioside GD3-synthase over expression inhibits survival and angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer cells through cell cycle arrest at S-phase and disruption of integrin-β1-mediated anchorage.	Gangliosides play important roles in the development, differentiation and proliferation of mammalian cells. They bind to other cell membrane components through their terminal sialic acids. Different gangliosides influence cellular functions based on the positions and linkages of sialic acids. Expression of gangliosides mainly depends on the status of sialic acid-modulatory enzymes, such as different types of sialyltransferases and sialidases. One such <protein-id="Q9GU23,Q9W121">sialyltransferase</protein-id>, disialoganglioside GD3 synthase, is specifically responsible for the production of GD3. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, making up more than 90% of pancreatic cancers, is a fatal malignancy with poor prognosis. Despite higher sialylation status, the disialoganglioside GD3 level is very low in this cancer. However, the exact status and function of this disialoganglioside is still unknown. Here, we intended to study the intracellular mechanism of disialoganglioside GD3-induced apoptosis and its correlation with the adhesion and angiogenic pathways in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrated that disialoganglioside GD3 synthase-transfected cells showed enhanced apoptosis and it caused the arrest of these cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. Integrins, a family of transmembrane proteins play important role in cell-cell recognition, invasion, adhesion and migration. disialoganglioside GD3 co-localised with integrin-β1 and thereby inhibited it's downstream signalling in transfected cells. Transfected cells exhibited inhibition of cell adhesion with extracellular matrix proteins. Enhanced GD3 expression down regulated angiogenesis-regulatory proteins and inhibited epidermal growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor-driven angiogenic cell growth in these cells. Taken together, our study provides support for the GD3-induced cell cycle arrest, disruption of integrin-β1-mediated anchorage, inhibition of angiogenesis and thereby induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.
10025831	Detection of liver metastases from pancreatic cancer using <protein-id="Q53HV7,A0A024RAZ8">FDG</protein-id> PET.	We evaluated the potential of the glucose analog [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (<protein-id="Q53HV7,A0A024RAZ8">FDG</protein-id>) as a PET tracer for the hepatic staging in 168 patients designated for resective pancreatic surgery. METHODS: Metastatic liver disease was confirmed or excluded during surgery or with CT follow-up for at least 6 mo. Proven metastases were then retrospectively identified on preoperative CT (gold standard). Hepatic PET scans of all patients were interpreted blindly. Any focal <protein-id="Q53HV7,A0A024RAZ8">FDG</protein-id> uptake was considered malignant. Both proven hepatic metastases and suspicious hepatic PET lesions were then compared, lesion by lesion, with CT. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and tumor-to-liver ratios (T/L) were determined for the most intense lesion of each patient. RESULTS: Sensitivity of <protein-id="Q53HV7,A0A024RAZ8">FDG</protein-id> PET was 68% (15 of 22 patients). The lesion detection rate was 97% (28 of 29 metastases) for lesions &gt;1 cm and 43% (16 of 37 metastases) for lesions &lt; or = 1 cm. Specificity was 95% (138 of 146 patients). Six of eight patients with false-positive results had marked intrahepatic cholestasis (versus 3 of 15 patients with true-positive lesions), one had an infrahepatic abscess and one had a right basal pulmonary metastasis. The SUV and T/L were 4.6+/-1.4 and 2.3+/-1.1, respectively, for malignant lesions and 4.1+/-1.5 and 1.9+/-0.3, respectively, for false-positive lesions and therefore are of limited value. CONCLUSION: <protein-id="Q53HV7,A0A024RAZ8">FDG</protein-id> PET provides reliable hepatic staging for lesions &gt;1 cm. False-positive results are associated with the presence of marked intrahepatic cholestasis. For lesions &lt; or = 1 cm, <protein-id="Q53HV7,A0A024RAZ8">FDG</protein-id> PET can define malignancy in 43% of suspicious CT lesions in the absence of dilated bile ducts. 
23215050	A cancer-specific variant of the <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">SLCO1B3 gene</protein-id> encodes a novel human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (<protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id>) localized mainly in the cytoplasm of colon and pancreatic cancer cells.	<protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> is a member of the OATP (organic anion transporting polypeptides) superfamily, responsible for mediating the transport of numerous endogenous and xenobiotic substances. Although initially reported to be exclusively expressed in the liver, several studies reported that <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> is frequently expressed in multiple types of cancers and may be associated with differing clinical outcomes. However, a detailed investigation on the expression and function of <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> protein in cancer has been lacking. In this study, we confirmed that colon and pancreatic cancer cells express variant forms of <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id>, different from <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> wild-type (WT) expressed in the normal liver. <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3 variant 1</protein-id> (V1), the most prevalent form among the variants, contains alternative exonic sequences (exon 2a) instead of exons 1 and 2 present in <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> WT. The translated product of <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> V1 is almost identical to <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> WT, with exception to the first 28 amino acids at the N-terminus. Exogenous expression of <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> V1 revealed that <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> V1 undergoes post-translational modifications and proteasomal degradation to a differing extent compared to <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> WT. <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> V1 showed only modest transport activity toward cholecystokin-8 (<protein-id="E9QEB3">CCK-8</protein-id>, a prototype <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> substrate) in contrast to <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> WT showing a markedly efficient uptake of <protein-id="E9QEB3">CCK-8</protein-id>. Consistent with these results, <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> V1 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm with a much lower extent of trafficking to the surface membrane compared to <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> WT. In summary, our results demonstrate that colon and pancreatic cancer cells express variant forms of <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> with only limited transport activity and different subcellular localization compared to <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> WT. These observed differences at the molecular and functional levels will be important considerations for further investigations of the biological and clinical significance of <protein-id="Q9NPD5,B3KP78">OATP1B3</protein-id> expression in cancer.
